### 2D Side Scroller Demo

Project overview and responsibilities: I acted as team lead and co level designer. I made the initial sketch to this level and made changes based on team feedback. After the level plan was finalized,
I built the level in engine, having myself and team members play though it constantly during each stage of the development process to ensure no bugs or if the player could get stuck. I placed items and enemies, and assested
team members with coding if needed. As team lead, it was also my responsibility to keep the project focused and ensure all assets were built and level delivered by the deadline.

### C++ HUD and actors

Project overview: This was my first big project using just C++ with little to no blueprints. The HUD while inspired by Witcher 3 is fully powered by C++ with only blueprints to place bar on screen, adding it to viewport, and additional animation
code for the health bar and magic bar to go up and down. The gun turns grey when it is on cooldown preventing spamming, fire damages the player, the cubes heal the player, and the player can't fire the gun if magic is too low and must wait for regen to kick in.

### Clean Your Room Demo

Project overview: The player must collect all red tokens before they are allowed to interact with the door and leave. Player collects the tokens by going to the red cubes and pressing E to collect. The cube actor then gets destroyed
in the level and a mario coin effect plays confirming the token has been collected. (No one tell Nintendo, please). The level also features a destructable wall that breaks apart with physics with its own sound effect.

### Paintball World Demo

Project overview: This is a FPS project. The player fires paintball guns from their paintball gun. The gun is used to destroy enemies that rush the player. No combat system so enemies just rush player and stand in the way. The gun also moves bright red objects that move 
only if hit by the paintball gun. The player will have to use this mechanic to reach the goal. The splat the paintball leaves when hitting a actor also has a random color element to prevent it from feeling too dull.
